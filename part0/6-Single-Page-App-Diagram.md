Here is a simple flow chart:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram;
    participant browser;
    participant server;
    Note left of browser: After the form is filled up and save button clicked...

   
    Note right of browser: JS script runs once button is clicked; Data is taken from form input and added to internal notes array as a key, value pair; JS script causes document to update with updated list




    
    

    

    
```
